        <h2><a id="overview">Overview</a></h2>
        <p>ruby-prof is a profiler for MRI Ruby. Its features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Speed - it is a C extension and therefore many times faster than
                    the standard Ruby profiler.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Measurement Modes - ruby-prof can measure program wall time,
                    process time, object allocations and memory usage</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reports - ruby-prof can generate a variety of text and
                    cross-referenced html reports</p>
                <ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Threads - supports profiling multiple threads simultaneously</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a id="why-ruby-prof">Why ruby-prof?</a></h2>
        <p>ruby-prof is helpful if your program is slow and you don't know why.
            It can help you track down methods that are either slow, allocate a
            large number of objects or allocate objects with high memory usage.
            Often times the results will be surprising - when profiling what you
            think you know almost always turns out to be wrong.</p>
        <p>Since ruby-prof is built using ruby's C <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.1/TracePoint.html">tracepoint
        </a>api, it knows a lot about your program. However, using ruby-prof
            also comes with two caveats:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>To use ruby-prof you generally need to include a few lines of
                    extra code in your program (although see <a href="#command-line"

                                                                title="Command Line"> command line usage</a>)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Using ruby-prof will cause your program to run slower (see <a href="#performance">
                    Performance</a> section) </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most of the time, these two caveats are acceptable. But if you need
            to determine why a program running in production is slow or hung, a
            sampling profiler will be a better choice. Excellent choices include <a

                    href="https://github.com/tmm1/stackprof">stackprof </a>or <a
                    href="https://rbspy.github.io/">rbspy</a>.</p>
        <p>If you are just interested in memory usage, you may also want to
            checkout the <a href="https://github.com/SamSaffron/memory_profiler">memory_profiler</a>
            gem (although ruby-prof provides similar information).</p>
        <h2><a id="installation">Installation</a></h2>
        <p>The easiest way to install ruby-prof is by using Ruby Gems. To
            install:</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">gem</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">install</span> <span

                class="ruby-identifier">ruby</span><span class="ruby-operator">-</span><span class="ruby-identifier">prof</span>
</pre>
        <p>If you are running Linux or Unix you'll need to have a C compiler
            installed so the extension can be built when it is installed. If you
            are running Windows, then you should install the Windows specific gem
            or install <a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/add-ons/devkit.html">devkit</a>.</p>
        <p>ruby-prof requires Ruby 2.7.0 or higher.</p>
        <p><strong>!!!WARNING!!!</strong></p>

        <p>Ruby versions 2.7.0 and 2.7.1 have a <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17152">bug</a>
            that can cause ruby-prof to return incorrect results.</p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <h2><a id="getting-started">Getting Started</a></h2>
        <p>There are three ways to use ruby-prof:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>command line</li>
            <li>convenience API</li>
            <li>core API</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Command Line  -->
        <h3><a id="command-line">Command Line </a></h3>
        <p>The easiest way to use ruby-prof is via the command line, which
            requires no modifications to your program.&nbsp; The basic usage is:</p>
        <pre>ruby-prof [options] &lt;script.rb&gt; [--] [script-options]<span
                style="color:#808080;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">"</span></pre>
        <p> Where script.rb is the program you want to profile.</p>
        <p>For a full list of options, see <a href="doc/RubyProf/Cmd.html">RubyProf::Cmd</a>
            documentation or execute the following command:</p>
        <pre>ruby-prof -h</pre>

        <!-- Convenience API -->
        <h3>Convenience API<span></span></h3>
        <p>The second way to use ruby-prof is via its convenience API. This
            requires small modifications to the program you want to profile:</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'ruby-prof'</span>

<span class="ruby-identifier">profile</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span><span

class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Profile</span>.<span

class="ruby-identifier">new</span>

<span class="ruby-comment"># profile the code</span>
<span class="ruby-object">profile</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">start</span>
<span class="ruby-comment"># ... code to profile ...</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">result</span> = <span class="ruby-object">profile</span>.<span

                    class="ruby-identifier">stop</span>

<span class="ruby-comment"># print a flat profile to text</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">printer</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span><span

                    class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">FlatPrinter</span>.<span

                    class="ruby-identifier">new</span>(<span class="ruby-object">result</span>)
<span class="ruby-object">printer</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">print</span>(<span

                    class="ruby-constant">STDOUT</span>)
</pre>
        <p>Alternatively, you can use a block to tell ruby-prof what to profile:</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'ruby-prof'</span>

<span class="ruby-comment"># profile the code</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">result</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span><span

                    class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Profile</span>.<span

                    class="ruby-identifier">profile</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-comment"># ... code to profile ...</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>

<span class="ruby-comment"># print a graph profile to text</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">printer</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span><span

                    class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">GraphPrinter</span>.<span

                    class="ruby-identifier">new</span>(<span class="ruby-object">result</span>)
<span class="ruby-object">printer</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">print</span>(<span

                    class="ruby-constant">STDOUT</span>, {})
</pre>
        ruby-prof also supports pausing and resuming profiling runs.
        <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'ruby-prof'</span>

<span class="ruby-identifier">profile</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span><span

class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Profile</span>.<span

class="ruby-identifier">new</span>

<span class="ruby-comment"># profile the code</span>
<span class="ruby-object">profile</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">start</span>
<span class="ruby-comment"># ... code to profile ...</span>

<span class="ruby-object">profile</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">pause</span>
<span class="ruby-comment"># ... other code ...</span>

<span class="ruby-object">profile</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">resume</span>
<span class="ruby-comment"># ... code to profile ...</span>

<span class="ruby-identifier">result</span> = <span class="ruby-object">profile</span>.<span

                    class="ruby-identifier">stop</span>
</pre>
        <p>Note that resume will only work if start has been called previously.
            In addition, resume can also take a block:</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'ruby-prof'</span>

<span class="ruby-identifier">profile</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span><span

class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Profile</span>.<span

class="ruby-identifier">new</span>

<span class="ruby-comment"># profile the code</span>
<span class="ruby-object">profile</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">start</span>
<span class="ruby-comment"># ... code to profile ...</span>

<span class="ruby-object">profile</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">pause</span>
<span class="ruby-comment"># ... other code ...</span>

<span class="ruby-object">profile</span>.<span.<span class="ruby-identifier">resume</span> <span

                    class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-comment"># ... code to profile...</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>

<span class="ruby-identifier">result</span> = <span class="ruby-object">profile</span>.<span

                    class="ruby-identifier">stop</span>
</pre>
        <p>With this usage, resume will automatically call pause at the end of
            the block.</p>
        <p>The <code>RubyProf.profile</code> method can take various options,
            which are described in the <a href="#profiling-options">Profiling
                Options</a> below. </p>

        <!-- Core API -->
        <h3>Core API</h3>
        <p>The convenience API is a wrapper around the the <code>Ruby::Profile</code>
            class. Using the Profile class directly provides addition
            functionality, such as <a href="#method-exclusion">method exclusion</a>.</p>
        <p>To create a new profile:</p>
        <pre>require 'ruby-prof'

profile = RubyProf::Profile.new(options)
result = profile.profile do
           ...
         end</pre>
        Once a profile is completed, you can either generate a <a href="#reports">report
    </a>via a printer or <a href="#saving-results">save</a> the results
        for later analysis. For a list of profiling options, please see the <a

        <h3><a id="measurements">Measurement Mode<br <="" a="">
        </a></h3>
        <p>The measurement mode determines what ruby-prof measures when
            profiling code. Supported measurements are:</p>
        <dl class="rdoc-list note-list">
            <dt>RubyProf::WALL_TIME</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Wall time measures the real-world time elapsed between any two
                    moments in seconds. If there are other processes concurrently
                    running on the system that use significant CPU or disk time during
                    a profiling run then the reported results will be larger than
                    expected. On Windows, wall time is measured using <code>GetTickCount()</code>,
                    on MacOS by <code>mach_absolute_time</code>, on Linux by <code>clock_gettime</code>
                    and otherwise by <code>gettimeofday</code>.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>RubyProf::PROCESS_TIME</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Process time measures the time used by a process between any two
                    moments in seconds. It is unaffected by other processes
                    concurrently running on the system. Remember with process time
                    that calls to methods like sleep will not be included in profiling
                    results. On Windows, process time is measured using <code>GetProcessTimes</code>
                    and on other platforms by <code>clock_gettime</code>.</p>

            <dt>RubyProf::ALLOCATIONS</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Object allocations measures show how many objects each method in

</pre>
        <h3><a id="allocation-tracking">Allocation Tracking</a></h3>
        <p>ruby-prof also has the ability to track object allocations. This
            functionality can be turned on via the track_allocations option:</p>
        <pre>require 'ruby-prof'

RubyProf.profile(:track_allocations =&gt; true) do
  ...
end</pre>
        <p>Note the <code>RubyProf::ALLOCATIONS</code> measure mode is slightly
            different than tracking allocations. The measurement mode provides
            high level information about the number of allocations performed in
            each method. In contrast, tracking allocations provides detailed
            information about the type, number, memory usage and location of each
            allocation. Currently, to see allocations results you must use the <a

                    href="doc/RubyProf/GraphHtmlPrinter.html"><code>RubyProf::GraphHtmlPrinter</code></a>.</p>
        <a id="thread-inclusion-exclusion">
            <h3>Thread Inclusion/Exclusion</h3>
            <p>ruby-prof can profile multiple threads. Sometimes this can be
                overwhelming. For example, assume you want to determine why your
                tests are running slowly.&nbsp; If you are using minitest, it will
                run your tests in parallel by spawning tens of worker threads (note
                to tell minitest to use a single thread set the N environmental
                variable like this ENV = 0). Thus, ruby-prof provides two
                options to specify which threads should be profiled:</p>
            <pre>exclude_threads::
    Array of threads which should not be profiled.

include_threads::
    Array of threads which should be profiled. All other threads will
    be ignored.</pre>
        </a>
        <h3><a id="method-exclusion">Method Exclusion</a></h3>
        <p>ruby-prof supports excluding specific methods and threads from
            profiling results. This is useful for reducing connectivity in the
            call graph, making it easier to identify the source of performance
            problems when using a graph printer. For example, consider <code>Integer#times</code>:
            it's hardly ever useful to know how much time is spent in the method
            itself. We are more interested in how much the passed in block
            contributes to the time spent in the method which contains the <code>Integer#times</code>
            call. The effect on collected metrics are identical to eliminating
            methods from the profiling result in a post process step.</p>
        <pre>profile = RubyProf::Profile.new(...)
profile.exclude_methods!(Integer, :times, ...)
profile.start</pre>
        <p>A convenience method is provided to exclude a large number of methods
            which usually clutter up profiles:</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">profile</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">exclude_common_methods!</span>
</pre>
        <p>However, this is a somewhat opinionated method collection. It's
            usually better to view it as an inspiration instead of using it
            directly (see <a
                    href="https://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof/blob/e087b7d7ca11eecf1717d95a5c5fea1e36ea3136/lib/ruby-prof/profile/exclude_common_methods.rb">github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof/blob/e087b7d7ca11eecf1717d95a5c5fea1e36ea3136/lib/ruby-prof/profile/exclude_common_methods.rb</a>).
        </p>
        <h3><a id="merge-threads">Merging Threads and Fibers</a></h3>
        <p>A common design pattern is to have a main thread delegate work
            to background threads or fibers (the rest of this section will just refer to worker
            threads to keep the text simpler). Examples include web servers, such as
            Puma and Falcon.</p>
        <p>Understanding profiling results for worker threads can be very difficult
            because there may be hundreds or thousands of them. To help with this,
            ruby-prof includes the ability to merge results for worker threads that start
            with the same parent method. In the best case, this can collapse
            results into two threads - one for the parent thread and one for all worker threads.</p>
        <p>Note the collapsed threads show the sum of times for all merged threads. For example,
            assume there are 10 worker threads that each took 5 seconds to run. The single merged
            thread will show a total time of 50 seconds. </p>
        <p>To merge threads:</p>
        <pre>profile = RubyProf.profile do
            ...
          end
profile.merge!</pre>
        <h3><a id="saving-results">Saving Results</a></h3>
        <p>It can be helpful to save the results of a profiling run for later
            analysis.&nbsp; Results can be saved using Ruby's <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Marshal.html">marshal</a>
            library.</p>
        <pre>profile_1 = RubyProf.profile do
  ...
end

<span class="ruby-comment"># Save the results<span style="color: white;"></span></span>
<span class="ruby-constant"></span>data = Marshal.dump(profile_1)<br><br><span class="ruby-comment"># Sometime later load the results</span>
<span class="ruby-constant"></span>profile_2 = Marshal.load(data)
</pre>
        <strong>!!!WARNING!!!</strong> - Only load ruby-prof profiles that you
        know are safe. Demarshaling data can lead to arbitrary code execution
        and thus can be <a
            href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Marshal.html#module-Marshal-label-Security+considerations">dangerous</a>.
        <h2><a id="reports">Reports</a></h2>
        <p>Once you have completed a profiling run, ruby-prof provides a number
            of reports that you can use to analyze the results. Reports are
            created via the use of printers:</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">profile </span>= <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span>.profile do <br>            ...<br>          end<br><span

                class="ruby-identifier">printer</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span><span

                class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">GraphPrinter</span>.<span

                class="ruby-identifier">new</span>(profile)
<span class="ruby-identifier">printer</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">print</span>(<span

                    class="ruby-constant">STDOUT</span>, <span class="ruby-value">:min_percent</span> <span

                    class="ruby-operator">=&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-value">2</span>)
</pre>
        <p>The first parameter is any writable IO object such as <code>STDOUT</code>
            or a file. The second parameter specifies the minimum percentage a
            method must take to be printed. Percentages should be specified as
            integers in the range 0 to 100. For more information please see the
            documentation for the different printers.</p>
        <p>The different types of reports, and their associated printers, are:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Flat Report (<a href="doc/RubyProf/FlatPrinter.html">RubyProf::FlatPrinter</a>)</dt>
            <dd>The flat report show the overall time spent in each method. Its is
                a good way of quickly identifying which methods take the most time.
                An example of a flat report can be found in <a href="./examples/primes.flat.txt">examples/primes.flat.txt</a>.
            </dd>
            <dt>Graph Reports (<a href="doc/RubyProf/GraphPrinter.html">RubyProf::GraphPrinter</a>)</dt>
            <dd>The graph report shows the overall time spent in each method. In
                addition, it also show which methods call the current method and
                which methods its calls. Thus they are good for understanding how
                methods gets called and provide insight into the flow of your
                program. An example graph report is located at <a href="./examples/primes.graph.txt">examples/primes.graph.txt</a>.

            <dd>HTML Graph profiles are the same as graph reports, except output
                is generated in hyper-linked HTML. Since graph reports can be quite
                large, the embedded links make it much easier to navigate the
                results. An example html graph profile is located at <a href="./examples/primes.graph.html">examples/primes.graph.html</a>.
            </dd>
            <dt>Call stack reports (<a href="doc/RubyProf/CallStackPrinter.html">RubyProf::CallStackPrinter</a>)</dt>
            <dd>Call stack reports produce a HTML visualization of the time spent
                in each execution path of the profiled code. An example can be found
                at <a href="examples/primes.stack.html">examples/primes.stack.html</a>.

        <h2><a id="performance">Performance</a></h2>
        <p>Significant effort has been put into reducing ruby-prof's overhead.
            Our tests show that the overhead associated with profiling code varies
            considerably with the code being profiled. Most programs will run
            approximately twice as slow while highly recursive programs (like the
            fibonacci series test) will run up to five times slower.</p>
        <h2><a id="profiling-rails"> Profiling Rails</a></h2>
        <p>To profile a Rails application it is vital to run it using production
            like settings (cache classes, cache view lookups, etc.). Otherwise,
            Rail's dependency loading code will overwhelm any time spent in the
            application itself (our tests show that Rails dependency loading
            causes a roughly 6x slowdown). The best way to do this is create a new
            Rails environment, profile.rb.</p>
        <p>To profile Rails:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create a new profile.rb environment. Make sure to turn on <code>cache_classes</code>
                    and <code>cache_template_loading</code>. Otherwise your profiling
                    results will be overwhelmed by the time Rails spends loading
                    required files. You should likely turn off caching.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the ruby-prof to your gemfile:</p>
                <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">group</span> <span
                        class="ruby-value">:profile</span> <span

                        class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">gem</span> <span class="ruby-string">'ruby-prof'</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the ruby prof rack adapter to your middleware stack. The
                    Rails <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-middleware"

                             title="Configure Middleware">documentation</a> describes several
                    ways to do this. One way is to add the following code to <code>application.rb</code>:</p>
                <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">if</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Rails</span>.<span

                        class="ruby-identifier">env</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">profile?</span>
  <code class="ruby plain">config.middleware.use</code> <span class="ruby-constant">Rack</span><span

                            class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span>, <span

                            class="ruby-value">:path</span> <span class="ruby-operator">=&gt;</span> <span
                            class="ruby-string">'./tmp/profile'</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>
                <p>The path is where you want profiling results to be stored. By
                    default the rack adapter will generate a html call graph report
                    and flat text report.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Now make a request to your running server. New profiling
                    information will be generated for each request. Note that each
                    request will overwrite the profiling reports created by the
                    previous request!</p>

        <h2><a id="version-1.0">Version 1.0</a></h2>
        <p>ruby-prof's development stretches all the way back to 2005. Fourteen
            years later, it seems time for version 1.0! Version 1.0 is a
            significant update that greatly improves the internals of ruby-prof
            and adds a number of improvements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Profiling is significantly faster (5x in some cases)</p>
            </li>
            <li>Recursive profiles are finally handled correctly.&nbsp; Yeah!!!</li>
            <li>Redesigned <a href="./examples/primes.graph.html">reports</a>.</li>
            <li>
                <p>The ability to measure allocations and memory usage using a
                    standard (unpatched) version of ruby</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The ability to save and reload profiling results for later
                    analysis</p>

                <p>The ability track object allocations</p>

            <li>New documentation <a href="https://ruby-prof.github.io">website</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the same time, it was also time to remove old code and deprecated
            methods. These changes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Drop support for old versions of ruby. Currently 2.4 and up are
                    required.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Remove support for method elimination (instead use <a href="#method-exclusion">method
                    exclusion</a>).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Remove the CPU_TIME measurement mode since it duplicates the
                    PROCESS_TIME mode and required inline assembly code</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Remove the GC_TIME and GC_RUNS measurement modes since they
                    required patched ruby versions. In modern ruby it is possible to
                    reimplement this functionality, but it does not seem of that much
                    value (shout out if you want it back).</p>
            </li>
            <li>Merge the <code>RubyProf::FlatPrinterWithLineNumbers</code>
                printer into <code>RubyProf::FlatPrinter</code>.
            </li>
            <li>Removed support for RUBY_PROF_EDITOR_URI environment variable that
                specified the link scheme. This features was more confusing then
                helpful.
